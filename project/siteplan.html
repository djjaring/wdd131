    <!-- 1. Site Name -->
    <section>
      <h2>Site Name</h2>
      <p><strong>Proposed Site Name:</strong> Pickleballeros Club</p>
      <p>
        This name represents a friendly Filipino–American pickleball community in Jacksonville, Florida.
        It feels energetic and fun, and it matches the group that is already playing together in real life.
      </p>
      <p><em>Optional domain idea:</em> pickleballerosclub.com (not required to purchase for this class).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Site Purpose -->
    <section>
      <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the Pickleballeros Club website is to provide a simple online hub for our local pickleball
        community in Jacksonville. The site:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduces new visitors to the Pickleballeros Club and our friendly, family–style atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Shares basic information about when and where we usually play.</li>
        <li>Shows photos from games so visitors can see what our meetups look like.</li>
        <li>Provides a membership form so interested players can join and receive schedule updates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The site is built as a small, mobile-first project with three main pages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Home:</strong> Overview, “Why Pickleballeros?”, weekly schedule, and club highlights.</li>
        <li><strong>Gallery:</strong> Hover/slide image gallery of our favorite pickleball moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Join:</strong> Membership form for people who want to connect and play with the club.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scenarios -->
    <section>
      <h2>Scenarios</h2>
      <p>These are sample questions that a typical visitor might have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Where and when does the Pickleballeros Club usually play in Jacksonville?”</li>
        <li>“How do I sign up to join the club and get schedule updates?”</li>
        <li>“I’m a beginner. Will there be players at my level, and what do I need to bring?”</li>
        <li>“Can I see pictures of what the games and group look like before I join?”</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Color Schema -->
    <section>
      <h2>Color Schema</h2>
      <p>
        The color scheme is designed to feel sporty, bright, and welcoming while keeping good contrast
        for readability.
      </p>

      <ul class="color-list">

          <span class="color-swatch color-primary"></span>
          <strong>Primary Color – #0B4F6C:</strong>
          Used for the header background, main navigation, buttons, and key headings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="color-swatch color-accent"></span>
          <strong>Accent Color – #FFD166:</strong>
          Used for call-to-action buttons, highlights, and small decorative accents.
        </li>

          <strong>Text Color – #1F2937:</strong>
          Used for body text and most paragraphs for strong contrast with the light background.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Typography -->
    <section>
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>
        The site uses a simple, modern typography system with one primary font family and
        one display font for headings.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Headings:</strong>
          <span class="font-heading">Poppins, sans-serif</span><br>
          Used for the site title, section headings, and navigation labels to provide a bold, sporty feel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Body Text:</strong>
          <span class="font-body">Inter, system-ui, sans-serif</span><br>
          Used for paragraphs, list items, and form labels for high readability on both mobile and desktop.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Wireframe -->
    <section>
      <h2>Wireframe</h2>
      <p>
        The following wireframes show the planned layout for the home page in both mobile and desktop views.
        They are simple sketches that represent where the logo, navigation, hero content, sections, and footer
        will appear.
      </p>

      <h3>Mobile Wireframe (Narrow View)</h3>
      <p>
        The mobile layout stacks content vertically: logo and site name at the top, a collapsible menu,
        a hero section with headline and call-to-action button, followed by sections for “Why Pickleballeros?”,
        “Weekly Schedule”, and “Club Highlights”, and then the footer.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/mobile.webp" alt="Mobile wireframe sketch for Pickleballeros home page">
        <figcaption>Figure 1: Home page layout for mobile view.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Desktop Wireframe (Wide View)</h3>
      <p>
        The desktop layout places the logo and navigation side by side in the header. The hero section stretches
        across the top of the page with a large image and a “Join the Club” button. Below that, content is organized
        into columns or cards for “Why Pickleballeros?”, “Weekly Schedule”, and “Club Highlights”, followed by a
        simple footer with location and copyright.
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Figure 2: Home page layout for desktop view.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <p>&copy; <span id="year"></span> Pickleballeros Club | Website Plan | WDD 131</p>
  </footer>

  <script>
    document.getElementById("year").textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
